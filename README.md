## Overview

Anemia is a common health condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. Early detection of anemia is crucial for timely medical intervention. This project utilizes a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of anemia based on specific patient data.

## Features

- Predicts the presence of anemia.
- User-friendly command-line interface for inputting patient data.
- Provides a simple prediction result.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `https://github.com/Sia-11/Anemia_Prediction_ML.git`

2. Set up a virtual environment for the project and install the required packages.

3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd anemia-prediction`

4. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Run the Anemia Prediction script: `python anemia_predictor.py`

6. Input patient data when prompted and get the prediction result.

## Project Structure
